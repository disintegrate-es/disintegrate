# Disintegrate

Disintegrate is a Rust library that provides an alternative approach to building domain objects from an event stream. While supporting traditional aggregates, Disintegrate introduces a novel method that allows for more flexibility and adaptability in modeling business rules.

## Why Disintegrate?

Disintegrate offers a fresh perspective on designing business applications by shifting away from relying solely on aggregates. Instead, it enables developers to construct business concepts directly from an event stream. This approach allows for decentralized and dynamic architectures that can evolve over time.

By leveraging the event stream as the foundation, Disintegrate empowers developers to build models that capture the essence of business events without the need for multiple versions of the same event within aggregates. This reduces duplication and complexity, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Key Features

* **Event Stream Modeling**: Disintegrate enables the construction of business concepts directly from an event stream, providing a more flexible and decentralized approach.

* **Support for Aggregates**: While promoting a new approach, Disintegrate still supports traditional aggregates, allowing developers to transition gradually or utilize both methodologies in their applications.

* **Adaptability to Changing Business Rules**: Disintegrate allows for easier evolution and adaptation to evolving business rules over time. By decoupling models from aggregates, developers gain the freedom to adjust and refine business concepts without heavy dependencies.

## Usage 

To add Disintegrate to your project, follow these steps:

1. Add `disintegrate` and `disintegrate-postgres` as a dependencies in your `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    disintegrate = "0.4.0"
    disintegrate-postgres = "0.4.0"
    ```

    * Disintegrate provides several features that you can enable based on your project requirements. You can include them in your `Cargo.toml` file as follows:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    disintegrate = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["macros", "serde-prost"] }
    disintegrate-postgres = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["listener"] }
    ```

    * The macros feature enables the use of derive macros to simplify events implementations.

    * For events serialization and deserialization, Disintegrate supports different serialization formats through the Serde ecosystem. You can enable the desired format by including the corresponding feature:

        * To enable JSON serialization, use the `serde-json` feature: `features = ["serde-json"]`.
        * To enable Avro serialization, use the `serde-avro` feature: `features = ["serde-avro"]`.
        * To enable Prost serialization, use the `serde-prost` feature: `features = ["serde-prost"]`.
        * To enable Protocol Buffers serialization, use the `serde-protobuf` feature: `features = ["serde-protobuf"]`.

    * If you're using the PostgreSQL event store backend and want to use the listener mechanism, you can enable the `listener` feature: `disintegrate-postgres = {version = "0.2.0", features = ["-listener"]`}.

2. Define the list of events in your application. You can use the Event Storming technique to identify the events that occur in your system. Here's an example of defining events using Disintegrate:

    ```rust,ignore
    use disintegrate::macros::Event;
    use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Event, Serialize, Deserialize)]
    #[group(UserEvent, [UserCreated])]
    #[group(CartEvent, [ItemAdded, ItemRemoved, ItemUpdated])]
    pub enum DomainEvent {
        UserCreated {
            #[id]
            user_id: String,
            name: String,
        },
        ItemAdded {
            #[id]
            user_id: String,
            #[id]
            item_id: String,
            quantity: u32,
        },
        ItemRemoved {
            #[id]
            user_id: String,
            #[id]
            item_id: String,
        },
        ItemUpdated {
            #[id]
            user_id: String,
            #[id]
            item_id: String,
            new_quantity: u32,
        },
    }
    ```

    In this example, we define an enum `DomainEvent` using the `#[derive(Event)]` attribute. The enum represents various events that can occur in your application. The `#[group]` attribute specifies the event groups, such as `UserEvent` and `CartEvent`, and their corresponding variants. This allows you to organize events into logical groups. The `#[id]` attribute on fields allows you to specify the domain identifiers of each event, which are used for filtering relevant events for a state.

3. Create a state that implements the `State` trait. A state represents a business concept in your application and contains the information necessary to make decisions based on a group of events. Here's an example of a state:

    ```rust,ignore
    use crate::event::CartEvent;
    use disintegrate::{query, State, StreamQuery};
    use std::collections::HashSet;
    use thiserror::Error;

    #[derive(Clone, Eq, Hash, PartialEq)]
    pub struct Item {
        id: String,
        quantity: u32,
    }

    impl Item {
        fn new(id: String, quantity: u32) -> Self {
            Item { id, quantity }
        }
    }

    #[derive(Default, Clone)]
    pub struct Cart {
        user_id: String,
        items: HashSet<Item>,
    }

    impl State for Cart {
        type Event = CartEvent;

        fn query(&self) -> StreamQuery<Self::Event> {
            query!(CartEvent, user_id == self.user_id)
        }

        fn mutate(&mut self, event: Self::Event) {
            match event {
                CartEvent::ItemAdded {
                    item_id, quantity, ..
                } => {
                    self.items.insert(Item::new(item_id, quantity));
                }
                CartEvent::ItemRemoved { item_id, .. } => {
                    self.items.retain(|item| item.id != *item_id);
                }
                CartEvent::ItemUpdated {
                    item_id,
                    new_quantity,
                    ..
                } => {
                    self.items.replace(Item::new(item_id, new_quantity));
                }
            }
        }
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Error)]
    pub enum CartError {
        // cart errors
    }

    /// Implement your business logic using the state
    impl Cart {
        pub fn new(user_id: &str) -> Self {
            Self {
                user_id: user_id.into(),
                items: HashSet::new(),
            }
        }

        pub fn add_item(&self, item_id: &str, quantity: u32) -> Result<Vec<CartEvent>, CartError> {
            // check your business constraints...
            Ok(vec![CartEvent::ItemAdded {
                user_id: self.user_id.clone(),
                item_id: item_id.to_string(),
                quantity,
            }])
        }
    }
    ```

    In this example, we define a `Cart` struct that implements the `State` trait. The `Cart` struct represents the state of a shopping cart and keeps track of the items added by users. 

4. Instantiate an event store, hydrate the `Cart` state, and invoke `add_item` method:

    ```rust,ignore
    mod cart;
    mod event;

    use cart::Cart;
    use event::DomainEvent;

    use anyhow::{Ok, Result};
    use disintegrate::{serde::json::Json, StateStore};
    use disintegrate_postgres::PgEventStore;
    use sqlx::{postgres::PgConnectOptions, PgPool};

    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() -> Result<()> {
        dotenv::dotenv().unwrap();

        // Create a PostgreSQL poll
        let connect_options = PgConnectOptions::new();
        let pool = PgPool::connect_with(connect_options).await?;

        // Create a serde for serialize and deserialize events
        let serde = Json::<DomainEvent>::default();

        // Create a PostgreSQL event store
        let event_store = PgEventStore::new(pool, serde).await?;

        // Hydrate the `Cart` from the event store
        let user_id = "user-1";
        let cart = event_store.hydrate(Cart::new(user_id)).await?;

        // Invoke add item method on the hydrated cart
        let changes = cart.add_item("item-1", 4)?;

        // Save the changes 
        event_store.save(&cart, changes).await?;
        Ok(())
    }
    ```
